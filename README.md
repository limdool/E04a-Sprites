# E04a-Sprites Exercise

In main1.py, I edited lines 26-32. I typed 'for i in range(20)' in line 27 and 'animal = random.choice(animals)' in line 28. The edition made 20 different animals appear randomly on the screen. 

In main2,py, I edited lines 48-56. I moved the aligator's position from the center. I also added a speech bubble above the aligator. Later, I put the bear on the right side of the aligator. I added the speech bubble above the bear. The edition made the aligator and bear began talking to each other.

In main3.py, I edited lines 40-42. I got rid of 'pass,' which was originally written in line 40. Then, I typed 'for a in self.animal_list.' In line 41, I typed 'a.center_x =x.' In line 42, I typed 'a.center_y = y.' The edition made a moose to follow my computer mouse. Wherever the mouse goes, the moose follows it.
